Title of the problem is: Insecure Data Handling. Here is the description of the problem: The function generate_meal_plan logs the entire generated meal plan, which could include sensitive information. This could lead to insecure data handling if logs are not properly secured.
And here are the codes where this problem is appearing:
backend/planGenerator.py:

    logger.info(f"Generating meal plan for: {description}, {diet_type}, {skill_level}, {length}, {meal_types}")

    prompt = f"""
    The user wants a meal plan with the following description: {description}. The user wants it to be for a {diet_type} diet and with a {skill_level} difficulty level for creating the meals. The meal plan should be for {length} days, with each day containing the following meals: {', '.join(meal_types)}. You will generate a one-sentence detailed description for each meal and output it in this JSON structure without any other details or comments:
{{ "mealPlan": {{ "days": [ {{ "date": "provide only number", "meals": {{ "meal_name": "string one sentence detailed description of that meal", "meal_name": "as many meals as provided by the user for one date" }} }} ] }}}}

You MUST ensure that the meals are unique and related to the user's preferences.

Use passive descriptions that do not directly address the user. Provide the general name of the meal along with its details.

Ensure that the meals are unique and tailored to the user's preferences.

Create {length} different days and meals. Be sure to include all {length} meals.
